- IMU != NWD ? --> If not, then we already know the orientation no ?

Data
- Why didn't you put the data in yaw instead of azimuth ? isn't the same thing ?

Task 1
    FACT : earth rotation amplitude is the same at any latitude,
    only the orientation change. Then why did you precise,
    earth rotation at EPFL latitude, when we compare only norms (amplitude)

    Question 1:
        Differences of norm at each given time t with (the norm of) w_ref?
            Yes : we get differences of norm of order 1e3, is it expected ?
            No : then what do you want exactly ?

    Question 2:
        Should we only use these differences to approximate the accuracy ?
            - Can we use projection of measurements using attitude of reference ?

Task 2
    Same questions as above
